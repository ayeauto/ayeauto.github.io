The Application is a free app for auto-rickshaw commutation available in India. The App is a convenient one for Searching, Finding, Booking and Taking rides in Autos nearest to the end user location, hello auto provides the user the search result based on the entry made. Users can lookup for Autos by entering the desired destination and/or a pick-up place from the mobile app.The Hello auto servers then fetches the closest Autos based on locations and sends the results to the user. The trip details including the projected fare and distance are listed, thereby giving the user the options, to choose from. The App features drag/drop and pick-up/destination points from the map. The destination also can be input as text,but its also not mandatory. There is a one-to-one negotiation happening between driver and rider based on destination and/or the fare, which results in booking or a no-booking. Note that Hello Auto cannot guarantee rides for users searches, nor do we involve in any kind of mediation/arbitration on deciding the trips. Negotiations occurs only between the end-users i.e. the booking happens with a first come first server policy between the driver and the rider. Once the booking succeeds, the users current locations are updated and shared with other user to help spotting and picking, withing the Application itself.Post booking, the app is locked for a time-out period, disallowing any further actions. There are booking indicators for easy spotting and picking right users. The GPS metering calculates the actual distance travelled at the end of trip and user gets notified about the distance and the fare of the trip. Users need to pay for the trip as what is calculated and displayed. Hello auto collects user information which are required to register for the service using the application and are not shared.These are used to validate the authenticity of the user and/or are the type of user-info used to determine users location, which helps to provide better service to the users, using the app.</p>
